## Hi there 👋

I'm Muinde Nthusi , a Nairobian, and Kenyan 🇰🇪, and African 🌍, and in that particular order. 

Talking about my hobbies and interests could fill up this entire page, but I'll do it anyway. I'm constantly curious, and seeking novelty. But coding, reading, gaming 🎮, golfing :	🏌️‍♂️, hiking mountains 🏕️, long distance running 🏃, photography 📷, and overlanding 🛣️ in my home country  🇰🇪 and continent 🌍 will probably be in my epitaph. I'm simply a nerd 🤓 + nature + earth guy with a dose of astronomy 🌌. 

Check out my portfolio on VSCO [https://vsco.co/mnthusi/gallery], and on my personal website [https://nthusi.github.io/elements/] if you're interested in viewing, and acquiring authentic African art. I'm not Basquiat, but I'm a starving artist 🎨, and curate elegant pieces.

I'm sure you're probably wondering when I'll get to the point, and end my soliloquy -- I get that a lot. But patience is a virtue my friend.

I love coffee ☕ from Rwanda's Lake Kivu, Ethiopia's Yirgacheffe region, and Kenya's Blue Mountain variant. Rooibos tea, and petrichor, and geosmin is therapuetic to me. Freshly brewed masala tea is heavenly, and there's a legendary Somali recipe that haunts me to this day. I love cooking and baking and twisting my wrists when I have the time (almost never). Ethiopian cuisine, Swahili cuisine, Italian cuisine, Japanese cuisine, and Levantine cuisine have made it to my mental recipes. 

As for books 📖, well, let's just say I'd have been a librarian in a world without computers. And I'm sure that you're picking something, perhaps a diagnosis, by now. I don't take myself too seriously, and you shouldn't too. Witcher 3: Wild Hunt GOTY edition, and Blood and Wine, and Hearts of Stone, and Gwent, and the Witcher Contracts, and the countless side quests consumed three months of my time: continuously, and without regret 🎮. Uncharted is an awesome franchise. Ratchet and Clank made my childhood, and piqued my interest in machine learning and robotics in the most rudimentary level. And I, Robot confronted me with the perils of sentient AI after Terminator sent mixed signals to my nascent mind. I've watched well over a thousand films 🎬, but I won't get into that lest I end up seeing myself on Reddit's 'okbuddycinephile'.

If you're still here that's great. I don't speak as much in in-person conversations, and that was the 'bolus'. Let's now get to the serious side.

I've been making websites 💻 since I was 13, and after discovering that computing 🧮 was an examinable subject in the Kenyan high school curriculum which was cool. I tinkered with Ruby on Rails after completing high school, and had made a rudimentary payment gateway web application before joining university. I studied medicine and surgery, and not computer science, but my passion for computers eclipsed my passion for medicine, and I find myself in uncharted waters: dreamy, optimistic, and excited.

I'm currently working on Python, and its behemoth software development framework Django, and its machine learning platforms: TensorFlow and SciKit learn.

Pronouns: he/him.

Fun facts: Orion is my favourite constellation ⭐. I resonate with Kid Cudi, and Kanye, and the legendary poet, Aubrey Graham 🤰. And astrophotography is my favourite form of photography 🌠.

Ask me about: solving complex problems in health, and in Africa with code. And how we can scale such solutions. We'll definitely need to start with a C4 diagram, and who knows? We might just make something work, and for the benefit of others.

Oooh, and I'm a medical doctor 🩺, but I don't do titles, and my profession most definitely doesn't build my identity and persona.
