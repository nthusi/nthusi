## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Muinde Nthusi , a Nairobian, and Kenyan, and African, and in that particular order. 

Talking about my hobbies and interests could fill up this entire page because I'm constantly curious, and seeking novelty. But coding, reading, gaming, hiking mountains, long distance running, photography, and overlanding in my home country and continent will probably be in my epitaph. I'm simply a nerd + nature + earth guy with a dose of astronomy. 

Check out my portfolio on VSCO [https://vsco.co/mnthusi/gallery], and on my personal website [https://nthusi.github.io/elements/] if you're interested in viewing, and acquiring authentic African art. I'm not Basquiat, but I'm a starving artist. 

I've been making websites since I was 13, and after discovering that computing was an examinable subject in the Kenyan high school curriculum which was cool.

I tinkered with Ruby on Rails after completing high school, and had made a rudimentary payment gateway web application before joining university.

I studied medicine and surgery, and not computer science, but my passion for computers eclipsed my passion for medicine, and I find myself in uncharted waters: dreamy, optimistic, and excited.

I'm currently working on Python, and its behemoth software development framework Django, and its machine learning platforms: TensorFlow and SciKit learn.

Pronouns: he/him.

Fun facts: Orion is my favourite constellation. I resonate with Kid Cudi, and Kanye. And astrophotography is my favourite form of photography.

Ask me about: solving complex problems in health, and in Africa with code. And how we can scale such solutions. We'll definitely need to start with a C4 diagram, and who knows? We might just make something work, and for the benefit of others.
