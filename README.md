## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Muinde Nthusi , a Nairobian, and Kenyan, and African, and in that particular order. 

Talking about my hobbies and interests could fill up this entire page because I'm constantly curious, and seeking novelty. But coding, reading, gaming, hiking mountains, long distance running, photography, and overlanding in my home country and continent will probably be in my epitaph. I'm simply a nerd + nature + earth guy with a dose of astronomy. 

Check out my portfolio on VSCO [https://vsco.co/mnthusi/gallery], and on my personal website [https://nthusi.github.io/elements/] if you're interested in viewing, and acquiring authentic African art. I'm not Basquiat, but I'm a starving artist. 

I'm sure you're probably wondering when I'll get to the point, and end my soliloquy -- I get that a lot. But patience is a virtue my friend.

I love coffee from Rwanda's Lake Kivu, Ethiopia's Yirgacheffe region, and Kenya's Blue Mountain variant. Rooibos tea, and petrichor, and geosmin is therapuetic to me. Freshly brewed masala tea is heavenly, and there's a legendary Somali recipe that haunts me to this day.

I love cooking and baking and twisting my wrists when I have the time (almost never). Ethiopian cuisine, Swahili cuisine, Italian cuisine, Japanese cuisine, and Levantine cuisine have made it to my mental recipes. But I usually settle for 'kibandaski' on most days which is Nairobian lingo or colloqualism for authentic Kenyan cuisine made with a mother's touch, and with fine dining, and otherworldly decor. Ask me about it, and I'll probably take you there.

As for books, well, let's just say I'd have been a librarian in a world without computers. And I'm sure that you're picking something, perhaps a diagnosis, by now. I don't take myself too seriously, and you shouldn't too. Frank Herbert's books could be plotted on a decay curve starting with Dune. Colson Whitehead deserves all those Pulitzer prizes. Chinua Achebe is an OG (original gangster). Binyavanga Wainaina is in my opinion, Kenya's best novelist as of now. And Ngugi wa Thiong'o is quite cool, and gives a radical, but accurate picture of my country in precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial times. Yaa Gyasi is amazing, and I giver her flowers. And Chimamanda Adichie is not only a great novelist, but an excellent wingman. Alice Walker writes well on the third wave of feminism, and the plight of black women, and deserves her Pulitzer many times over. Tom Mboya is a personal legend, and wrote timeless books on Kenya, on Africa, and on the dreams of her people. 

Shakespeare was cool. Nietzsche had a beautiful mind. Marcus Aurelius should have taken a chill pill, and walked away from everything like Muad'Dib in Dune Messiah. But Socrates was, and still is, in my honest opinion one of the most remarkable humans I've come across.

Witcher 3: Wild Hunt GOTY edition, and Blood and Wine, and Hearts of Stone, and Gwent, and the Witcher Contracts, and the countless side quests consumed three months of my time: continuously, and without regret. Uncharted is an awesome franchise. Ratchet and Clank made my childhood, and piqued my interest in machine learning and robotics in the most rudimentary level. And I, Robot confronted me with the perils of sentient AI after Terminator sent mixed signals to my nascent mind. 

I've watched well over a thousand films, but I won't get into that lest I end up seeing myself on Reddit's okbuddycinephile.

If you're still here that's great. I don't speak as much in in-person conversations, and that was the 'bolus'. Let's now get to the serious side.

I've been making websites since I was 13, and after discovering that computing was an examinable subject in the Kenyan high school curriculum which was cool.

I tinkered with Ruby on Rails after completing high school, and had made a rudimentary payment gateway web application before joining university.

I studied medicine and surgery, and not computer science, but my passion for computers eclipsed my passion for medicine, and I find myself in uncharted waters: dreamy, optimistic, and excited.

I'm currently working on Python, and its behemoth software development framework Django, and its machine learning platforms: TensorFlow and SciKit learn.

Pronouns: he/him.

Fun facts: I can deadlift 200 kgs without straps. Orion is my favourite constellation. And astrophotography is my favourite form of photography.

Ask me about: solving complex problems in health, and in Africa with code. And how we can scale such solutions. We'll definitely need to start with a C4 diagram, and who knows? We might just make something work, and for the benefit of others.
