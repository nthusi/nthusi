## Hi there 👋

I'm Muinde Nthusi, a Nairobian, and Kenyan 🇰🇪, and African 🌍, and in that particular order. 

I've been making websites 💻 since I was 13, and after discovering that computing 🧮 was an examinable subject in the Kenyan high school curriculum which was cool. I tinkered with Ruby on Rails after completing high school, and had made a rudimentary payment gateway web application before joining university. I studied medicine and surgery, and not computer science, but my passion for computers eclipsed my passion for medicine, and I find myself in uncharted waters: dreamy, optimistic, and excited.

I'm currently working on Python, and its behemoth software development framework Django, and its machine learning platforms: TensorFlow and SciKit learn.

Pronouns: he/him.

Fun facts: Orion is my favourite constellation ⭐. I resonate with Kid Cudi, and Kanye, and the legendary poet, Aubrey Graham 🤰. And astrophotography is my favourite form of photography 🌠.

Ask me about: solving complex problems in health, and in Africa with code. And how we can scale such solutions. We'll definitely need to start with a C4 diagram, and who knows? We might just make something work, and for the benefit of others.

Oooh, and I'm a medical doctor 🩺, but I don't do titles, and my profession most definitely doesn't define my identity and persona.
